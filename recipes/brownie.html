        <li>200 g Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>200 g Dark Chocolate Chips</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C.</li>
        <li>Spray a 20cm/8" square tin with oil and line with baking paper with overhang.</li>
        <li>Place butter and chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl, microwave in 30 second bursts until melted. Stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and vanilla, mix, then add eggs and mix well until smooth and molten.</li>
        <li>Add flour, cocoa and salt and stir until smooth. Stir in chopped chocolate, pour into pan.</li>
        <li>Bake 24 minutes for really gooey in the centre, 28 minutes for fudgey but still very moist, 32 minutes for moist fudge-cake like.</li>
        <li>If you didn't use the extra chocolate for stirring in, reduce cook time by 2 minutes.</li>
